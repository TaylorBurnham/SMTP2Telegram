# SMTP2Telegram

I wanted a simple way to receive SMTP requests and relay them to Telegram to keep messages secure and avoid more and more email. This was inspired by David Bilay's [Mail2Telegram](https://github.com/dYalib/Mail2Telegram) script.

# TODO List

* Add in CLI params with dotenv support
* Clean up code and add docstrings
* Add in template handling
* Make it look more better?

# Usage

TBD

# Roadmap

None until I need it, so you should fork it if you want more out of it.
